This subproject consists of a water simulation, a fire simulation, and a firework simulation.

In all simulations, the camera can be controlled with the mouse (rotate) and the "wasd" keys (translate).
The water and fire simulations support user interaction, i.e. interacting with the particle system with a sphere.
Press "G" key to grab and release the sphere. When the sphere is grabbed, it will follow the movement and rotation of the camera.

Source file needs to be manually switched in order to run different animations.
